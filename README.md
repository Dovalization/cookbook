# Cookbook üç≥

A collection of automation recipes for streamlining personal workflows, knowledge management, and everyday digital tasks in the era of artificial intelligence.

*Cookbook: Because good automation, like good cooking, starts with having the right recipes.*

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress, some recipes may be incomplete, broken, or not fully tested. That said, contributions are welcome! ‚ö†Ô∏è

## What is Cookbook?

Cookbook is a personal toolkit of Python scripts that automate the tedious parts of work. Each "recipe" solves a specific problem - transcribing audio, scraping web content, organizing files, or connecting different parts of your digital workflow.

Think of it as your automation catalog: individual recipes that work standalone, but can be combined to create more complex workflows.

## Personal Motivation

This project exists because I got tired of doing the same manual tasks over and over again. As someone with ADHD, I need external systems to handle the routine tasks so my brain can focus on the important stuff.

Every script in this collection solves a real friction point in my daily workflow:

- **Meeting transcripts** - I record everything but never had time to review what was said.
- **Web research** - Bookmarking articles I'd never read again in a useful format.
- **File organization** - Opinionated file structure designed for productivity, quick capture and retrieval.
- **Context switching** - Keep track of evolving requirements and tasks and minimize distractions.

The goal isn't to automate everything, but to automate the annoying things that drain mental energy without adding value. I'm designing each recipe to work with my natural workflow, not how productivity apps think I should work.

## Technical Principles

### Keep It Simple
- Each script solves exactly one problem
- Prefer composition over complexity
- Add features based on actual usage, not speculation

### Local First
- Work offline when possible
- User owns their data
- Privacy-first approach with local LLMs when needed

### Gradual Adoption
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Scripts work independently before integration
- Easy to disable/modify any component

### ADHD-Friendly Design
- Reduce cognitive load, don't add it
- Automate the boring parts, surface the important parts
- Clear feedback on what's happening

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dovalization/cookbook.git
cd cookbook
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your settings

# Try a recipe
python -m scripts.example_script input.txt
```

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for future dashboard API
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript (future phases)
- **Database**: SQLite for development/simple deployments
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with secure token storage
- **Development**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Testing**: pytest with mocking for APIs

### Development Philosophy
- **Build what you need, when you need it**
- **Start with manual processes, then automate the painful parts**  
- **Every script should solve a real problem you're actually having**
- **Perfection is the enemy of automation**

```bash
# File processing paths
INBOX_PATH="./inbox"
OUTPUT_PATH="./output"
BACKUP_PATH="./backup"

# LLM Configuration

## Development Roadmap

For detailed development phases and milestones, see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Current Phase: Core Foundation
We're building the essential infrastructure:
1. **LLM Abstraction Layer** - Flexible AI provider interface
2. **Content Processing Pipeline** - Standardized text processing
3. **Enhanced File Utilities** - Robust file handling and organization
4. **Testing Infrastructure** - Solid testing foundation
5. **Docker Setup** - Containerized development environment

### Next Steps
1. Complete LLM abstraction with API provider support
2. Build basic content processing capabilities
3. Set up Docker development environment
4. Create first real automation script (likely `summarize_content.py`)

## Recipe Template

Each script follows a consistent pattern:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Recipe: Short description
Purpose: What problem this solves
Input: What it expects
Output: What it produces
"""

def main(input_path: str, **kwargs):
    # Recipe logic here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # CLI interface
    pass
```

## Usage Examples

### Standalone Scripts
```bash
# Transcribe a meeting recording (future)
python -m scripts.transcribe_audio meeting.wav

# Scrape an article for research (future)
python -m scripts.scrape_webpage https://blog.example.com/post --tags research,ai

# Summarize any text file (future)
python -m scripts.summarize_content document.txt
```

### Current Working Example
```bash
# Process any text file with basic metadata
python -m scripts.example_script input.txt --move-original
```

## Integration Philosophy

Cookbook is designed to work with your existing tools:
- **Local LLMs** - Uses OLLAMA for privacy-first AI processing  
- **File watchers** - Can monitor folders for automatic processing
- **Git hooks** - Trigger workflows on repository changes
- **Homelabs** - Designed to run on personal infrastructure
- **Future**: Slack, Google Workspace, Jira integration

## Development

### Adding New Recipes

1. Create your script in `scripts/`
2. Follow the template pattern
3. Add shared utilities to `shared/` if needed
