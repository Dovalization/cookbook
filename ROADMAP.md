- [ ] Add parallel processing for batch operations

### 6.2 Core Workflows
- [ ] **Meeting Processor**: Audio ‚Üí Transcription ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Action Items
- [ ] **Research Assistant**: URL ‚Üí Content ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Tagged Notes
- [ ] **Content Pipeline**: Any input ‚Üí Processed ‚Üí Categorized ‚Üí Stored

## Implementation Notes

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phases 1-3** can be developed independently
- **Phase 4** required before Phase 5 (integrations need auth)
- **Phase 7** (dashboard) can be built anytime after Phase 2 (needs storage)
- **Phase 8** (knowledge management) benefits from all previous phases

### Flexibility Points
- **LLM Provider**: Start with API (OpenAI/Anthropic), add Ollama later
- **Database**: SQLite for development, can upgrade to PostgreSQL for production
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for local, Kubernetes for production
- **UI Framework**: Next.js planned, but could use other frameworks

### Risk Mitigation
- Each phase delivers working functionality
- Scripts work independently before integration
- Can pause development at any phase and still have value
- Modular architecture allows easy replacement of components


## Measuring Success

### Weekly Metrics
- Number of manual tasks automated
- Time saved through automation
- Scripts actually used vs. built

### Monthly Metrics  
- Reduction in context switching
- Important information capture rate
- System reliability and uptime

### Quarterly Metrics
- Overall workflow improvement
- Knowledge management effectiveness
- User satisfaction with automation

The goal is not to build everything, but to build what actually improves daily workflow and reduces cognitive load.
