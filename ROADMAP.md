## Implementation Notes

### Phase Dependencies
- **‚úÖ Phase 1.1 COMPLETE**: Solid foundation for all future development
- **Phases 1.2-3** can be developed incrementally
- **Phase 4** required before Phase 5 (integrations need auth)
- **Phase 7** (dashboard) can be built anytime after Phase 2 (needs storage)
- **Phase 8** (knowledge management) benefits from all previous phases

### Flexibility Points
- **‚úÖ LLM Provider**: Full abstraction complete - OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama supported
- **Database**: SQLite for development, can upgrade to PostgreSQL for production
- **Deployment**: Architecture ready for Docker Compose ‚Üí Kubernetes progression
- **UI Framework**: Next.js planned, but could use other frameworks

### Risk Mitigation
- **‚úÖ Each phase delivers working functionality** - Phase 1.1 has shown this approach works
- **‚úÖ Scripts work independently** - No complex dependencies between automation
- **‚úÖ Can pause development at any phase** - Already have valuable automation working
- **‚úÖ Modular architecture** - Easy to replace or enhance any component

## Measuring Success

### Weekly Metrics (Going Forward)
- Number of manual tasks automated
- Time saved through automation
- Scripts actually used vs. built

### Monthly Metrics  
- Reduction in context switching
- Important information capture rate
- System reliability and uptime

### Quarterly Metrics
